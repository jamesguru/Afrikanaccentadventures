              The Namibian Bank allows you to exchange all freely convertible
              currencies and traveller's cheques into Namibian Dollars. At
              bigger branches you find ATM's, where you can draw money with a
              credit or Maestro card. The banks are usually open on weekdays
              from 9:00 to 15:30. Some are closed at midday between 13:00 and
              14:00 pm. The Namibian Dollar is on par with the South African
              Rand (1:1). At present (April 2011) 1 Euro equals about 10 N$.

              The southern winter (May - September) in Namibia is characterised
              by pleasant day temperatures (about 25 degrees C), while the
              nights are very cold; often below zero. One should bring both,
              summer clothes and warm jerseys. During the summer months, day
              temperatures can soar to well over 30 degrees C while night brings
              little relief. Many people struggle to sleep well in the heat. For
              the summer months you will need light and airy clothes; sun-hats,
              sun-glasses, sun-tan lotion and firm shoes are indispensable.

              In 1993 the Namibian Dollar (N$) was introduced. It is on par with
              the South African Rand (1:1), because the two countries' economies

            <span>
              Namibia forms a Customs Union with the other Southern African
              countries. No customs on all personal items. Custom-free one can

              subject to harsh costums regulations. The import of a vehicle for
              own use requires a Carnet de Passage document, issued by the
              Automobile Association in your country. A refundable deposit must
              be paid. After your travels, you have to take the vehicle out of
              Namibia again; you are not allowed to sell it in Namibia or South
              Africa.

              remote areas, one should always take lots of bottled water along.

              The voltage in Namibia is 220-230 V, AC (identical to South
              Africa). Adapters are for sale at most supermarkets. Farmers often
              generate their own electricity with a diesel generator, which they
              usually only run during the day. At night it's candlelight or
              light from a 12 Volt battery.

              Visitors from Europe need for a stay of not more than 90 days only
              a valid passport (valid for at least 6 months longer than the
              departure date). There are special regulations for longer stays.
              Wrong dates on the stamps or other errors eventually are to the
              detriment of the visitor. Check immediately if all entries are
              correct. It is possible to import hunting rifles. The permit is
              issued at entry. You have to produce a fire arm licence from your
              home country.

              Quite a number of airlines service Windhoek, some on a daily
              basis. The flying time on a direct flight is 9 to 10 hours. Prices
              vary a lot, depending on the season and airline. The most
              expensive times are around Christmas and Easter as well as from
              July to September. Air Namibia services from Windhoek

            <span>
              Most visitors enter Namibian grounds at Hosea Kutako International
              Airport in Windhoek. It is about 45 km out of town, because
              Windhoek is nestled in a narrow valley. The Eros Airport which is
              closer to town does not have a runway for larger aircraft and is
              being used for domestic flights and by local charter companies
              only. At present the national airline Air Namibia flies with its
              A340 Airbus fleet six times a week directly from Frankfurt to
              Windhoek. Air Berlin flies from Munich to Windhoek, twice a week.
              All other airlines - Lufthansa, SAA, KLM, Swiss, British Airways -
              service Windhoek via Johannesburg only, which increases the travel
              time from 10 to about 12 to 14 hours, often at a cheaper tariff,
              though. Emirates has longer stops in Dubai, Qatar Airways in
              Qatar. The formalities of entry are uncomplicated for visitors
              from EU countries and a maximum stay of three months. Visa are
              issued at entry. Your passport has to be valid for another 6
              months..

            <h3>Climate and Travel Seasons</h3>
            <span>
              With 300 days of sunshine on average per year, Namibia is truly a
              sunny place. It rains sometimes, during the summer months from
              November to February usually in form of cloudbursts. In this
              "rainy season" - which is a slightly exaggerated term - the dry
              riverbeds, called "riviere", get filled with torrents of muddy
              water for a short time. Then the sun-scorched land comes to life
              and develops a colourful horizon to horizon floral carpet within a
              few days. Namibia can be travelled at any time of the year. The
              best time, however, are the months from April to October, when the
              temperatures are around 25 degrees during the day and the sky is
              always blue. The nights are cool, but a pleasantly dry cold. The
              dry winter months (July to September) are also a good time to
              visit this desert country. The day temperature usually stays above
              20 degrees. But on the central plateau and in the Namib desert the
              nights can be freezing.

            <span>
              VAT is charged at 15%. If one has bought expensive items, one can
              produce the tax invoices and get a VAT refund at the Hosea Kutako
              Airport.

            <h6>Vaccinations</h6>
            <span>
              For Namibia no vaccinations are required. Some countries recommend
              vaccinations against tetanus, diphtheria, polio and hepatitis A
              and B. Malaria-prophylactic (like Lariam) is only necessary, if
              you are planning to visit areas north of the Etosha Park or in the
              Caprivi. It is most essential to cover yourself from mosquito
              bites, since no remedy offers total protection. Cover yourself as
              completely as possible and rub the remaining exposed skin: neck,
              face, hands, wrists, ankles with Tabbard. If you still contract
              malaria, despite taking medicine, you are going to be defenseless
              against the virus. On return from a malaria infested area, watch
              out for symptoms and see a doctor immediately, if they arise to
              get medication as early as possible. Proof of a recent yellow
              fever vaccination is required, if you enter from a yellow fever
              area.

              The medical services are generally very good, at least in the

              Swakopmund have a good reputation. Although most doctors are
              General Practitioners, there are also some specialists in the
              country. At present, only patients who require heart surgery need
              to go to Cape Town. The best private clinic is in Windhoek:
              Mediclinic, Heliodor Street, Klein-Windhoek, Tel 061-222687.
              Medical Air Rescue Service: ISOS, Tel 061-249777. Medrescue,

            <span>
              Ask your medical aid, whether you are covered when travelling in
