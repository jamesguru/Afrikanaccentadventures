            <h3>Rwanda</h3>
            <span>
              Rwanda, the land of 1,000 hills, has become quite a famous
              destination for tourism. The country located in Central Africa is
              a haven for natural vegetation, wildlife, mountains, pristine
              topography, volcanoes, waterfalls and rainforests. The Parc des
              Volcans is one of the last sanctuaries where one can find the
              mountain gorilla in their natural habitat. Rwanda is situated in
              the region of Great Lakes and has many beautiful and serene lakes
              bordering it.

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <span>
              Rwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate, with lower
              temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries due to its
              high elevation. Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a
              typical daily temperature range between 12 °C and 27 °C, with
              little variation through the year.

            <h3>Topography</h3>
            <span>
              The country's is located on the great East African plateau, with
              the Nile and Congo rivers passing in a north–south direction
              through the western part of the country. To the west of the
              divide, the land drops sharply to Lake Kivu in the Great Rift
              Valley; to the east, the land falls gradually across the central
              plateau, its grassy highlands are the core areas of settlement of
              Rwanda`s peoples - to the swamps and lakes on the country`s
              eastern border. Almost all of Rwanda is at least 1,000 metres
              above sea level; the central plateau is between 1,500 and 2,000
              metres high. In the northwest on the border with the DRC are the
              volcanic Virunga Mountains; the highest peak, Mt. Karisimbi 4,519
              metres is snowcapped. Lake Kivu, 1,460 metres above sea level,
              drains into Lake Tanganyika through the sharply descending Ruzizi
              River. The Kagera River, which forms much of Rwanda`s eastern
              border, flows into Lake Victoria.
