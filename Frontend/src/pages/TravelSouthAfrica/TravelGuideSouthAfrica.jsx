            <h3>South Africa</h3>
            <span>
              South Africa is among the most pristine tourist destinations not
              only in the African continent but also globally. Her modern set-up
              is akin to many first-world countries while her abundance of
              natural gems rivals any safari destination in the continent. The
              country boasts memorable sceneries including the sun-kissed shores
              of Indian and Atlantic oceans, her incredible deserts and
              picturesque mountains. If you are a lover of nature or the unique
              offerings of African modernity, then South Africa is your ideal
              destination.

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <span>
              South Africa is located in a subtropical region, moderated by
              ocean on two sides of the triangle-shaped country and the altitude
              of the interior plateau. These account for the warm, temperate
              conditions so typical of South Africa and so popular with its
              foreign visitors. The country is relatively dry with an average
              annual rainfall of about 464 metres. South Africa`s coastal
              regions have the warmest winter temperatures in the country.

            <h3>Topography</h3>
            <span>
              South Africa's coastline stretches more than 2,500 Kilometres from
              the desert border with Namibia on the Atlantic coast, southwards
              around the tip of Africa, then north to the border with
              subtropical Mozambique on the Indian Ocean. The Karoo plateau,
              where rocky hills and mountains rise from sparsely populated
              scrubland, is very dry, and gets more so as it shades in the
              north-west towards the Kalahari desert. It gets extremely hot in
              summer, and it can be frosty in winter. There are two main rivers
              in South Africa; River Limpopo part of which flows in Zimbabwe and
              River Orange.
