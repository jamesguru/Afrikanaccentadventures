            <h3>Botswana</h3>
            <span>
              Botswana is a beautiful land locked nation bordered by Namibia to
              the west and northwest, Zimbabwe to the east and South Africa to
              the south. Botswana`s geo-set up is characterized by a sandy
              basins and scrub savannah. The country`s most prolific touristic
              gem is the Kalahari Desert and her vast expanse of semi-arid
              valleys. The desert covers almost 85 percent of the entire
              country. Other attractions include the Okavango River up North,
              and several wildlife reserves that make Botswana an authentic
              African country. These wildlife reserves include Moremi Wildlife
              Reserve and the Chobe National Park, as well as the Makgadikdadi
              and Nxai Pans National Park.

              Botswana is landlocked and has a subtropical desert climate
              characterized by great differences in day and night temperatures,
              virtually no rainfall and overall low humidity. The dry season
              runs May to October with little to no rain during the entire
              winter and low humidity, 20 to 40%. The temperatures are
              relatively cool, typically 10°C in the morning and 28°C in the

              start to appear, bringing cooler temperatures and an occasional
              late afternoon shower. This pattern of change continues in
              December, with typical temperatures between 20°C in the morning
              and 33°C in the afternoon.

            <h3>Topography</h3>
            <span>
              Botswana is a broad tableland with average altitude of 1,000
              metres. A vast plateau about 1,200 metres in height, extending
              from near Kanye north to the Zimbabwean border, divides the
              country into two distinct topographical regions. The eastern
              region is hilly bush country and grassland. To the west lie the
              Okavango Swamps and the Kalahari Desert. The only sources of
              year-round surface water are the Chobe River in the north, the
              Limpopo in the southeast, and the Okavango in the northwest.
