            <span>
              Known as the Pearl of Africa, Uganda is a beautiful land-locked
              country famous for her rich culture, her lush green topography and
              her Mountain gorillas. Every year tourists come to the extreme
              south-western corner of the country to see the amazing mountain
              gorillas. Other attractions include the 43 metre-high Murchison
              Falls along the Victoria Nile, Bujagali Falls famous for kayaking
              and bungee jumping, the Rwenzori Mountain and the tombs of Buganda
              Kings at Kasubi in Kampala which are listed as a World Heritage
              site.

              Since Uganda lies on the equator, there is minimal change in
              temperature and no real winter or summer. Hottest months are
              January and February when average daytime range is 24-33°C with
              highs of up to 40°C in the northern areas. The south has two wet

              season is from December to February and June - July. With 1000 to
              2000mm of rain annually, it can rain at almost any time. The
              north, including Murchison Falls and Kidepo Valley, has one
              continuous wet season from March to November and a dry season from
              December to February.
